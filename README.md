# Urban Sound Classification using CNN

This project implements a deep learning–based system to classify urban sounds such as sirens, drilling, and street noise using audio data.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on features extracted from the UrbanSound8K dataset to automatically identify different sound classes. The project highlights the use of audio classification in smart city and urban development applications.
